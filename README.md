# End-to-End Data Management Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
This project aims to design and implement a robust data management pipeline for predicting customer churn using machine learning. The pipeline covers all stages from data ingestion to model deployment.

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, leading to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. This project focuses on building an automated pipeline to predict and reduce churn.

## Pipeline Stages
1. **Problem Formulation**: Define the business problem, objectives, and data sources.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Fetch data from CSV files and REST APIs.
3. **Raw Data Storage**: Store data in a structured format (e.g., S3).
4. **Data Validation**: Perform data quality checks and generate reports.
5. **Data Preparation**: Clean, preprocess, and explore the data.
6. **Data Transformation**: Engineer features and store them in a database.
7. **Feature Store**: Manage and retrieve features for model training.
8. **Data Versioning**: Track changes in datasets using DVC.
9. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate a churn prediction model.
10. **Pipeline Orchestration**: Automate the pipeline using Apache Airflow.
